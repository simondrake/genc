# Genc

Genc is a CLI tool to expose useful commands for encryption and decryption.

It is in very early development, so it comes with no assurances. It has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux. It _may_ work with your system, but it is in no way guaranteed.

**Note:** Expect breaking changes to occur until `v0.1.0`.

# Setup/Installation

* Install - `go install github.com/simondrake/genc@latest`

# Notes

* The `pkcs7` commands currently only support PKCS1 Private Keys

# Usage
